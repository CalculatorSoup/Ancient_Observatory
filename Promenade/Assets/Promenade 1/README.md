# Ancient Observatory
An alternate Stage 5 environment, created from scratch in the style of vanilla maps, set on a vast floating island populated with ruins and blanketed by a canopy of trees. If you took Sky Meadow, Desolate Forest and Temple of the Elders from RoR1 and mixed them in a blender, it would make this map, probably.

The map's a bit larger than Sky Meadow and has a somewhat multi-layered layout, with cliffs, slopes, and caves to navigate. There are jump pads scattered throughout to help with traversal.

## Simulacrum
This mod also includes a Void replication of Ancient Observatory with some (very) minor changes, exclusive to SotV's Simulacrum gamemode.
